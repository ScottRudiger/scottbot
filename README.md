## Purpose

Scottbot is a [Slack](https://slack.com/) app built on [Auth0's](https://auth0.com/) easy-to-use serverless platform, [Webtask](https://webtask.io/).

One thing you can ask Scottbot to do is play a multiplayer game:

### Start a game with a mention: `@scottbot play guess-the-combo`.

<sup>(Type it more naturally if you like; e.g., `@scottbot play a game please!` As long as it contains the word `play`, a game will start up. 👍)</sup>

<hr>

### Get some help (`@scottbot help`).

<sup>(`@scottbot HELP MEEEEE!!!` would also work. 🤣 Or, just click the `help` button on any game's keypad.)</sup>

<hr>

### Click around and try to guess the right combination!

### Check out the rankings: `@scottbot show guess-the-combo rankings`.

<sup>(In case you forget the exact wording, Scottbot will also reply to `@scottbot What's my rank?` or `@scottbot SHOW ME THE RANKS!!!` If your mention contains either `show` or `rank`, he'll be happy to tell you where you stand compared with the other players. 🥇🥈🥉...🤔)</sup>

### Reactions
Scottbot will also react when a Slack message contains any word or emoji that is also a reaction, and, will react the same way as you when you add a reaction:

Reactions :a:, :blue_heart:, :m:, :on:, and :robot_face: are automatically added by Scottbot. User manually adds :heart: and :+1: reactions; then, Scottbot duplicates them.">
